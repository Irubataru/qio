        <p>QCD Input/Output Applications Programmer Interface developed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing (SciDAC) program.</p>

<p>The QIO package supports data parallel input and output for QCD applications. Although it was originally developed to support the data parallel lattice-QCD API called QDP/C and QDP++, it is designed to function independently of QDP, requiring only the lower level QMP message passing package. It has been used successfully with other higher-level software packages. Three data models are treated: full volume lattice fields, consisting of data of the same format residing on each site of a hypercubic lattice, subvolume lattice fields, consisting of data of the same format residing on a hypercubic subset of a hypercubic lattice (e.g.\ a 3D time slice), and global data constant across all lattice sites. Lattice field data is distributed among multiple nodes.</p>

<p>The file format consists of a series of logical records. Each record contains user-controlled metadata and binary data. An arbitrary combination of logical records is permitted. The physical file format is based on a custom SciDAC LIME standard, (Lattice QCD Interchange Message Encapsulation), which views the file as a series of LIME messages, each, in turn, consisting of a series of LIME records. Details of the physical format are hidden from the user. The <a href="http://usqcd-software.github.io/c-lime">LIME</a> package is included with QIO.</p>
